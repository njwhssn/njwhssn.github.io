          I find it challenging to maintain efficient classroom management with large 
          student groups. But I believe the volume at which I project my voice is adequate. 
          The way the students conducted themselves in big groups reminded me of how most 
          of the teachers who work with them act in the same way. In my next class, I'm 
          going to rearrange their seats.

          Since I was teaching three Inspirasi classes during our instructional period, I was 
          able to accomplish a lot of work thanks to their excellent level of English proficiency. 
          In particular, they are fast learners and are advanced learners, so it is better for 
          them to learn while doing activities.

          You could argue that I have to go through the same thing. A particular group 
          of students persistently tries to capture my attention. I figured that was 
          because it was our first class together and they wanted me to get to know 
          and recognise them.
