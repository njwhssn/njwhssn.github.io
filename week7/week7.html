        <p class="information">
          As usual, I managed to get my tasks done but it's almost to it's due. I personally 
          think that it is because I need to catch up a lot since we have just started new session.

          I best believe that my projection is loud. However, I still cannot control the class 
          very well since the students were in big groups and the best solution that I should take 
          note is by buying a portable wired microphone to be used in class. It is better since I 
          don't have to try hard in delivering my lessons in class.

          I never knew the way teachers enroll the students to each sports and uniform club. 
          On this 1st week, I have been assigned for 3 times to help registering students to their 
          chosen clubs and sports. Indirectly it enhanced my skills of documenting student's detail in the website.

          I could say it's the same thing I need to go through. However, this happens due to our different races. 
          I noticed an indian student did not ask for my permission when he was about to get out of the class. Anyhow, 
          I just assumed that is because of our first class together and will find a way to tackle my students' needs and interest.
