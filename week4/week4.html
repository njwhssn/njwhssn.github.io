          I need to buy a mini microphone every time I need to get into my relief 
          classes especially form 1. Relief to form 1 classes is challenging as they 
          are in big amount and unfortunately I always need to bring them down at the 
          Foyer since tons of classes need to be used as SPM's hall.  I do have a good 
          voice projection yet it is not good for me for a long term durations.

          Since I was assigned to few duties this week, I believe that I have developed new

        <p class="information">
          Still, my threats would be student-teacher interaction. On Friday, I need to relief 
          for 4 Intelek class and they were asked to be in the Foyer but they wouldn't want. 
          Their way of communication towards me can be considered quite casual (not minding their 
          boundaries to me as student - teacher). In other words, I am not pleased with their jokes 
          and communication skills to me.
