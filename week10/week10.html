          Since I got 3 Inspirasi class to be taught, I managed to conduct a

          of proficiency in English. To explain more, they are advanced students 
          and catch up the lesson even in a very short time, so it's better for 
          them to learn while doing activities.

          I could argue that I must experience it in the same way. A particular 
          group of students consistently makes an effort to capture my interest. 
          In any case, I simply assumed that was the reason, as they wanted me to 
          know and recognise them, since it was our first class together.
