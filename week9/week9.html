          Up until this point, I never rejected any tasks they assigned me 
          to. Hence why, I best believe among other practicum teachers as 
          well, I'm the one who got to enhance my skills to one day be a

          Since the students were grouped into large groups, I still

          I believe that my voice projection is loud enough. Because they 
          were in big groups, the students' attitudes reminded me of what 
          most of the teachers who instruct them also do. In my next class, 
          I'm planning to rearrange their seating again.

          Since I got 3 Inspirasi class to be taught, I managed to conduct a 
          lot of activities during our lesson period due to their high level 
          of proficiency in English. To explain more, they are advanced students 
          and catch up the lesson even in a very short time, so it's better for 
          them to learn while doing activities.

        <p class="information">
          I could argue that I must experience it in the same way. A particular 
          group of students consistently makes an effort to capture my interest. 
          In any case, I simply assumed that was the reason, as they wanted me to 
          know and recognise them, since it was our first class together.
