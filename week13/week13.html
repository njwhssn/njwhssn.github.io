          I think my projection of voice is loud enough. Since students were 
          grouped into large groups, I still struggle to maintain good 
          classroom management. Nevertheless, I believe that my voice 
          projection is loud enough. Because they were in big groups, the 
          students' attitudes reminded me of what most of the teachers who 
          instruct them also do.

          I had no notion how teachers enrolled their students in sports and 
          uniform clubs. This first week, I have been entrusted with helping 
          students register for clubs and sports three times. It made it 
          easier for me to unintentionally enter students' information into 
          the website.

          Not because I don't try to improve, but the problems are just 
          frequent when they start to pose the greatest risks to me. 
          I'm an understanding and accommodating teacher, but I've 
          become aware that my students don't always adhere to my 
          directions. For this reason, I think the best way for me to 
          lessen the problems is to be less willing to compromise with them.
