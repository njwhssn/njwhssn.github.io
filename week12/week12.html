          I completed my tasks as usual, but they are almost overdue. I believe it's because

          I have been tasked with assisting students with club and sport registration three

          I could argue that I must experience it in the same way. But this is a result 
          of our racial differences. As one of the Indian students was ready to leave 
          the classroom, I noticed he hadn't asked for my permission. In any case, I 
          just assuming that was the result of our first day together, and I'll work to 
          meet the needs and interests of my students.
