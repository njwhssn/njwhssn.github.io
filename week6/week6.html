          On the last week of 2023/2024 session, I actuallly improved my quality

          I best believe that my projection is loud. However, I still cannot control 
          the class very well since the students were in big groups and the best solution 
          that I should take note is by buying a portable wired microphone to be used in class. 
          It is better since I don't have to try hard in delivering my lessons in class.

          During last week of school, I was assigned to be the Emcee again for Selasa Bertema 
          programme. Even though I was so nervous at that time, the audience really gave me a 
          positive responses and feedback and that is more than enough to portray that I have 
          done a very good job as an Emcee.

        <p class="information">
          It's not that I don't attempt to get better, but the issues are just common when 
          they become my biggest threats. Since I'm a flexible and accommodating teacher, 
          I've noticed that my students don't really follow my instructions. Because of this, 
          I believe that reducing my willingness to compromise with them is the most effective 
          methods for me to lessen the issues.
